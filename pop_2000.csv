1,"The Labour force survey collection of tables, starting with number 282-, is large with many possible cross-tabulations for the 10 provinces and other geographic regions. To ensure respondent's confidentiality, detailed data are suppressed. Data for Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia are suppressed if the estimate is below 1,500, for Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, if the estimate is below 500, and for Prince Edward Island, under 200. For suppression levels within census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and economic regions (ERs), use the respective provincial suppression levels above. While suppressing to protect respondent confidentiality has the added effect of blocking-out the lowest-quality LFS data, some remaining non-suppressed data in these very large LFS CANSIM tables may be of insufficient quality to allow for accurate interpretation. Please be warned that the more detailed your LFS CANSIM download, the smaller the sample size upon which your LFS estimates will be based, and the greater the risk of downloading poorer quality data.",,,,,,,,,,,
2,"Fluctuations in economic time series are caused by seasonal, cyclical and irregular movements. A seasonally adjusted series is one from which seasonal movements have been eliminated. Seasonal movements are defined as those which are caused by regular annual events such as climate, holidays, vacation periods and cycles related to crops, production and retail sales associated with Christmas and Easter. It should be noted that the seasonally adjusted series contain irregular as well as longer-term cyclical fluctuations. The seasonal adjustment program is a complicated computer program which differentiates between these seasonal, cyclical and irregular movements in a series over a number of years and, on the basis of past movements, estimates appropriate seasonal factors for current data. On an annual basis, the historic series of seasonally adjusted data are revised in light of the most recent information on changes in seasonality.",,,,,,,,,,,
3,For more information on seasonal adjustment see Seasonal Adjustment and Trend-cycle Estimation.,,,,,,,,,,,
4,Estimates from this table are based on 2006 census population counts.,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"This table will be archived and replaced by table 282-0135 as of January 28th, 2015. See Table 282-0116 to 282-0135 to obtain the vector concordance table.",,,,,,,,,,,

7,"A census metropolitan area (CMA) is a large urban area (known as urban core) together with adjacent urban and rural areas (known as urban and rural fringe) that have a high degree of social and economic integration with the urban cores. A CMA has an urban core population of at least 100,000.",,,,,,,,,,,
8,"Estimates in this table are based on 2006 census boundaries. For comparisons before 1996, please use the concordance table in the CANSIM What's new announcement from December 17, 2010. Note that with the change to the 2006 census boundaries, six new CMAs were added (Moncton, New Brunswick; Peterborough, Ontario; Brantford, Ontario; Barrie, Ontario; Guelph, Ontario; Kelowna, British Columbia). Also, the boundaries of seven CMAs were modified (Québec, Quebec; Sherbrooke, Quebec; Montréal, Quebec; Ottawa-Gatineau, Quebec part; Ottawa-Gatineau, Ontario/Quebec; London, Ontario; Winnipeg, Manitoba).",,,,,,,,,,,
9,"Due to a slightly smaller sample size relative to other CMAs, the unemployment level and rate in Kelowna and Peterborough has more sampling variability, and should therefore be interpreted with caution.",,,,,,,,,,,
